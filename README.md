### Notes
- XCode version different from the video guide, lauch screen not initialized.
  - Solution: add lauch screen file manually, and change the name to corresponding name to be able to include in the app.
  - Note: The file name has to be the same, possible other solution need to be further explored.
- Issue with text view to controler mapping:
  - Solution: figured out that there was a wrong duplicated controller link to the text view, delete duplicate can solve the problem.
  - Note: Make sure to check the controller mapping after it is established.
- Network issue with calling tmdb APIs
  - Solution: tried to call tmdb APIs directlly and still not working, then realized that I used http protocol rather than https protocol, changed to https as documented in the tmdb website fixed issue.
  - Note: be sure to distinguish https and http.
